🚀 Welcome to this Helm Charts repository. 
This repo is a fork of the well known bjw-s-labs repo.
I created the fork because I like to be a bit paranoid about other's git repos. So feel free to be paranoid as well and fork mine 😊.

Additional features you can find here:
  * dev-container that can be used with vscode

It is going to contain my Helm charts while utilizing the helm library of bjw-s.
This repo is **not** intended to be a replacement for any of the large collections of Helm charts that are out there.

Planned features:

 * seccompProfile support in helm library
 * seccompProfile hardened helm charts

## Development

If you want to use this repo as a base for your development and you utilize vscode like me, there are some hints to get you setup:
In order to initialize your containers work directory properly on linux, you will need to run:

``` sudo chown $USER:$GID /workspace ```

otherwise you will be stuck with an unwriteable /workspace directory owned by root.
Apparently this behaviour seams to be a bug in the devcontainers of microsoft.

## Installation

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts in this repository.

The Helm repository can be installed as follows:
